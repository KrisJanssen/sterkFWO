Hi,

This is my first post on my brand new Jekyll based blog.

On this blog I will post interesting things I come accross on all things tech and science.

I hope you will like it!

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
function HelloWorld(){
   myname = "Kris";
   alert(myname);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].

Rafa says hello!
